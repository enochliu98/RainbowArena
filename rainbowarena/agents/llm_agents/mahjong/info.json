    "prompt_rule":"Your are playing Mahjong. Mahjong is a tile-based game developed in China, and has spread throughout the world since the 20th century. It is commonly played by 4 players. The game is played with a set of 136 tiles. In turn, players draw and discard tiles until someone wins by completing a legal hand. The goal of the game is to complete a legal hand using the 14th drawn tile to form 4 sets and a pair. We revised the game into a simpler version where all winning hands are considered equal, and a player wins as long as they successfully form 4 sets and a pair.",
